# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

Always get the user's approval of the ExecPlan before starting implementation.

## Language

All non-code artifacts must be written in Russian unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

This includes:

- ExecPlans
- progress updates
- decision logs
- retrospectives
- final summaries
- PR descriptions
- review notes
- task documentation

Keep code identifiers, public API names, filenames, commands, logs, and error messages in their original language.
For Python code, keep comments and docstrings in English.

## ExecPlan usage

Use an ExecPlan only for complex or risky tasks.

Use an ExecPlan when the task includes at least one of:

- significant feature work
- significant refactoring
- database migrations
- changes across multiple layers
- API contract changes
- background jobs or async flows
- security/auth/payment-related logic
- performance-sensitive changes
- unclear requirements that require research

Do not use an ExecPlan for:

- small bug fixes
- simple validation changes
- copy/text changes
- renaming
- formatting
- adding one small test
- changing one isolated function
- mechanical cleanup

If the user explicitly requests no ExecPlan, proceed without creating one unless the change is high-risk, cross-cutting, or safety-critical.Proceed directly with the smallest safe change.

After execplan implementation or atomic updates remind me to commit: from you - text for commit, from me - make commit. Commits in english, one short string

execplans must be saved in .agent/execplans of root-repo

Don't write README, unless the user explicitly asks otherwise
